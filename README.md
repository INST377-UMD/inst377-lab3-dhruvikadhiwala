# INST377-Lab

# Comments: 
In addition to the required HTML + CSS layout, I added game functionality using JavaScript.  
The page now allows the user to enter their name, choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and play against the computer.  
The result (win/lose/tie) is displayed instantly based on the comparison logic.  

I want to note that I already have experience HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I implemented the logic myself.  
This lab was a chance to show how I can integrate all three to build a complete interactive webpage rather than just a static layout.
